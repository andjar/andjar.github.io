We recognize that pregnancy is a truly remarkable process, requiring a delicate balance within the immune system that constantly changes to support both the mother and the developing baby. Problems with this balance can lead to serious pregnancy complications, from infertility to preterm birth or preeclampsia. While we know some things about the immune system in early pregnancy, much less is understood about its behavior in the later stages, particularly when pregnancies go beyond their due date. Understanding these dynamic immune changes, and how factors like a mother's health or the baby's sex might influence them, is crucial for improving care. To address this, we undertook a comprehensive study, analyzing over a thousand blood samples from more than 700 pregnant women, to map the patterns of 22 different cytokines – important signaling molecules that reflect the body's immune state – from the first trimester right through to term and beyond. Our aim was to create a detailed and reliable reference of cytokine profiles in normal pregnancies, filling a significant gap in our current knowledge.

Our findings revealed that the levels of these cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, followed distinct but characteristic patterns throughout pregnancy, clearly demonstrating that the immune system adapts in stages. We observed that inflammatory cytokines generally peaked in the first trimester, decreased in the second (a period focused on fetal growth), and then increased again towards the end of the third trimester. CRP was an interesting exception, peaking in the second trimester, which suggests it might play a role in healing rather than just inflammation during this phase. A particularly robust finding was the steady decrease of eotaxin throughout pregnancy, which we identified as a reliable indicator of a normal pregnancy progression, largely unaffected by other factors. As pregnancies continued beyond term, we observed a strong and broad surge in most cytokine levels, which became even more pronounced as labor approached. This suggests that advancing pregnancy beyond term and the physiological preparation for labor contribute significantly to immunological activity and potential stress.

This study also highlighted how various maternal and fetal factors uniquely influence the immune system during pregnancy. For example, maternal obesity and smoking were linked to sustained increases in distinct cytokine levels throughout pregnancy, indicating ongoing immunological stress. We found that women who had given birth before (multiparous) showed stronger immune activity in the first trimester, while first-time mothers (nulliparous) had increased immune activity in the third trimester. Furthermore, pregnancies with a female fetus showed higher cytokine levels in the first trimester. By providing this comprehensive reference of normal cytokine profiles across gestation and detailing the impact of various factors, our findings are invaluable for future research into both healthy pregnancies and those with complications. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that maternal serum cytokine profiling offers an accessible and sensitive way to explore the complex immune system during pregnancy, potentially helping to uncover more mysteries of human development and improve maternal-fetal care.
