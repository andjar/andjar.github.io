Color is part of your voice, yet most of us keep palettes scattered across screenshots, notes, or one-off scripts. Palettr fixes that with a single self-contained web page: a minimal, fast, local-first palette library you can open in any browser. Add colors inline, or drop in an image to extract a clean set via in-browser k‑means—complete with a tiny preview—then copy a palette as an R vector or export the whole library as an R list in one click.

Like a modern, color-focused TiddlyWiki, Palettr stores your data inside the HTML itself. Click “Save as HTML” to bake updates right into the file, host it on GitHub Pages in seconds, and—if you want—push changes back to your repo via the GitHub API. No servers, no dependencies, no build step; everything runs privately in your browser. Fork it, make it yours, and keep your visual language consistent across every figure you share.
