AudioAnnotatr is a zero‑setup, browser‑based waveform viewer and timestamp annotator that lets you mark key moments in audio with speed and precision. Open an audio file, scrub the waveform, and drop annotations exactly where they matter using Shift+Click or the playhead. Zoom and pan to focus on details, and toggle between relative timing and an absolute time axis so you can align events to real‑world clocks—all while everything runs locally for privacy and snappy performance.

When you’re done, export a clean, portable JSON that slots straight into scripts, spreadsheets, or ML pipelines—and import it later to keep working. Whether you’re a podcaster outlining edits, a journalist logging interviews, a UX researcher tagging insights, or a student studying lectures, AudioAnnotatr trims the friction from timestamping so you can stay focused on the content. Open it, load a file, and start capturing the moments that matter.
