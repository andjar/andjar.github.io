If you’ve ever hesitated to share a scan of your passport, driver’s license, or a sensitive document, this tool removes the trade-off between verification and privacy. With a single command, it burns a clear, repeated watermark across your image—custom text in bold red, optionally timestamped—so anyone who receives it knows exactly who it was sent to and why. That context makes leaked copies less useful to bad actors, while the diagonal, semi-transparent style keeps key details legible for legitimate checks. It’s fast, local, and simple: point it at your files (images or PDFs), tell it what to say, and it delivers watermarked outputs in a tidy folder.

Beyond identity verification, the same workflow protects everyday sharing: add “Confidential — Finance team only” to internal snapshots, “Draft — Do not circulate” to design comps, or “Sent to RentalCo for application review” to utility bills. The script supports common image formats and converts PDFs to images automatically, letting you tune angle, opacity, spacing, and font for the right balance of readability and deterrence. In a world where files are forwarded endlessly, this tiny habit adds a visible layer of intent and accountability—without adding friction.
