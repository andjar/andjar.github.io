The three friends - Raske (Quick) the fox, Kose (Lazy) the rabbit, and Farlig (Dangerous) the frog - experience various challenges in everyday life - a little brother who runs faster, a birthday they're dreading, and a secret balloon that breaks - and together with the Fox King, they find solutions. Each story consists of ten pages with text and accompanying illustrations.

This is likely the first published Norwegian children's book that is fully illustrated with the help of generative AI.

The book is available for purchase:
