"You: a collection" is an innovative exploration of artistic collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence. This anthology features texts drawn from an unpublished work, "VÃ¥re livs dager," originally written for a birthday in 2019. These poignant pieces capture the essence of growing up and have been translated into English and set to music generated by Suno AI, with manual transcription. The book is meticulously revised by the author, who also designed the cover photography. Published under Lulu.com, this unique collection utilizes the Victor Mono typeface, traditionally used in programming for its clarity and precision, reflecting the book's harmonious blend of human and algorithmic creation. The sparse illustrations are algorithmically generated from each piece's musical scores, adding a visual dimension to the artistic narrative. This anthology is an artistic journey that pushes the boundaries of traditional literature, inviting readers to experience the synergy between man and machine.
